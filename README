Server and client code for creating real time group-editable form fields. Right now this is just a proof of concept. Please see TODO for information on what needs to happen before this is more widely usable.

Installation
-------------
1. includes/config.inc.editme - rename to config.inc and add your db info
2. import db structure from files in sql/


Demo Files
-------------
index.php - this is a hardcoded demo that uses a doc with id 1

templates/pages/index.inc - currently contains all javascript for driving the front-end diff and merging. this code will eventually be moved to assets/js


JSON(P) API
-------------
api/createdocument.php - returns JSON(P) with id of a new document

api/getdocument.php?doc_id=[id] - returns JSON(P) with document revision and content

api/getupdates.php?doc_id=[id]&rev_id=[revision] - returns JSON(P) with all diff revisions since supplied rev_id

api/submitrevision.php
 POST: doc_id=[id] current_rev=[rev_id] loc=[change_location] op=['add' or 'del'] data=['added or deleted string']
 RETURNS: JSON of latest document revision


TODO
-------------

- need simple auth/security infrastructure around document updates. Ie. need a read only mode with unguessable url, and some kind of edit key without which changes can't be made.

- break out front end javascript into simple to use jQuery module. should be able to do something like $('#textarea_id').groupedit( server, docid, editkey );

- might need to revisit get-vs-post for updates. want this to work cross-domain, but need to do a security audit and deal with message sise limitations of a get request.

- probably need to prune old revisions to keep database from getting too full

- API for making snapshots?

- API for retrieving old versions / interface for doing rollbacks.
